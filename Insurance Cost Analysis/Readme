Insurance Cost Analysis

Objectives: 
 - Load the data as a `pandas` dataframe
 - Clean the data, taking care of the blank entries
 - Run exploratory data analysis (EDA) and identify the attributes that most affect the `charges`
 - Develop single variable and multi variable Linear Regression models for predicting the `charges`
 - Use Ridge regression to refine the performance of Linear regression models. 

Setup:
- skillsnetwork to download the data
- pandas for managing the data.
- numpy for mathematical operations.
- sklearn for machine learning and machine-learning-pipeline related functions.
- seaborn for visualizing the data.
- matplotlib for additional plotting tools.
